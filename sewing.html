            These are outifts I made to display at the fabric store where I used
            to work. I eventually took them home but they are currently sitting
            in my sewing pile as I didn't bother to make any mock ups and ended
            up with lots of fit isssues I need to fix. oops

            <h3>Cranach gown:</h3>
            <img
              class="right"
              style="width: 420px"

            <p>
              In 2015, I decided to attempt to make a more historically accurate
              costume for the Renaissance Faire. At the time, I was really into
              Landsknecht uniforms and the fashions of early 16th-century
              Germany. I got several yards of green cotton velveteen for the
              dress, along with some silk satin for the trim and cotton for the
              chemise. Because I spent all my money on fabric, I had no money
              for patterns and had to draft the dress pattern from scratch. For
              the goldhaube/cap, I used the pattern from
              <a
                href="http://germanrenaissance.net/german-goldhaube-cap-of-silk-gold-and-pearls-pattern-instructions-documentation-and-notes/"
                target="_blank"
                >here.</a
              >
              This website was super useful for info on this period of German
              fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I got my materials, I started by drafting the pattern for the
              hemd/chemise. It was very simple to draft, as it was just a bunch
              of rectangles. Originally, I planned to smock the neckline and
              cuffs but decided against it as I wanted a smoother look. I sewed
              it up, and I hand-embroidered the collar of the hemd with gold
              thread. I also started to embroider the cuffs but stopped when I
              realised they wouldn't be visible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, I started drafting the pattern for the dress itself. This
              was my second time drafting a dress pattern, and I didn't really
              know what I was doing, so I struggled a lot and made lots of
              mistakes. I had a lot of fun figuring out how to do the sleeves,
              though. After I got the fit as good as I could, I machine-sewed
              all the inside seams and hand-sewed the visible seams.
            </p>

            <img
              class="left nofloat"
              style="height: 380px"
              src="images/sewing/cranachdress_and_suit.png"
              alt="Brown 16th century damask suit"
            />

            <p>
              Lastly, I made a tellerbarret, a giant round hat covered in
              feathers, and a goldhaube, a golden cap covered in pearls. For the
              tellerbarret, I cut a long rectangle out of my cotton velveteen
              and gathered it into a circle over a big wire hoop. I then covered
              it in feathers. My mom did all the beading on the goldhaube, and
              then I sewed it together. I stuffed it with wool to pad it out. It
              was extremely heavy from all the pearls, so I had to use a bunch
              of hair pins to keep it on my head, but it turned out beautifully.
            </p>
            <h3>Brown 16th century suit:</h3>

            <p>
              I also made an outfit for my dad to wear to the faire. It wasn't
              based on any specific region or decade. Just generic fantasy/16th
              century inspired. I used one of his old shirts to draft the
              doublet and drafted the trunkhose and shirt from scratch. The
              trunkhose turned out a little sad, so I stuffed a bunch of tulle
              inside to make them puffier. This was my first time making clothes
              for someone else. I'm really surprised at how well this outfit
              turned out, especially the trunkhose because I'd only ever made
              one pair of pants before. My dad learned some embroidery to
              decorate the cuffs and collar of the shirt. My dad has worn this
              outfit to the faire several times, and it's still holding up.

            <h3>Discord Costume:</h3>
            <img
              class="right"
              style="width: 316px"
              src="images/sewing/discordsandhudsonleick.jpg"

            />
            <p>
              I made this for XenaCon in 2022. My friend and I both decided to
              go as the character "Discord," the Goddess of Retribution. I went
              in her regular costume, and my friend did an amazing recreation of
              her 1950s-style undersea outfit from the episode "Married with
              Fishsticks." It was a bit difficult to find good reference images
              for this costume. Since it's an older show, it can be hard to get
              high-quality images of the costumes. I watched all her episodes
              and took a bunch of screenshots of her costume from various
              angles.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the bodice pattern, I altered a corset pattern from Aranea
              Black to give it bust cups. The cups didn't fit and looked a
              little sad, but they successfully covered my boobs. I boned the
              corset with a bunch of spiral steel I took from a corset I made
              years ago. I couldn't really tell what material her bodice was
              made of. I tried a bunch of different options and finally settled
              on two layers of black tulle over canvas fabric, though I don't
              think that's what they used. After sewing the bodice base, I cut
              out a bunch of strips of pleather and spent 100 years applying a
              bunch of metal studs. I glued these strips over the bodice, trying
              to follow the pattern of the reference images I had while also
              covering the boning channels. For the collar, I sewed together a
              bunch of trapezoids from the corset fabric and covered it in
              pleather traingles.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              I made the bracers from the same metal studs and strips of
              pleather I used for the bodice. I glued them onto some zip ties to
              make them stiffer and added lacing rings to lace them on with
              ribbon. I tried using hooks and eyes for the closure, but they
              were too difficult to put on and take off that way. I spent a long
              time trying to find stretch lace that looked like what they used
              for her sleeves on the show, but eventually gave up and cut up
              some fishnets. The skirt is just a basic circle skirt I made from
              some stretch pleather. I didn't even add a waistband since the top
              is hidden by the bodice.

              In the show, Discord has leather boots, but I didn't have the
              budget for a new pair of boots or the time to try and make shoe
              covers/gaiters so I just wore some heels. I also didn't bother to
              try and recreate her iconic hairstyle, as my hair is too thin and
              short on its own, and I didn't want to wear a wig. Other than
              those two things, I think this costume turned out pretty close to
              the original. I really enjoyed making the corset, and while the
              bust is wonky and there are some wrinkles due to the stretchiness
              of the tulle, I'm happy with how it turned out. At some point, I
              may remove the bust cups and turn it into a more wearable corset.
