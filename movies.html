      <h2>Horror Movies</h2>

      <p>
        My favourite movie genre is horror. I watched a lot of classic horror
        movies with my dad when I was growing up, including some I was way too
        young for. The first one I remember watching was The Exorcist when I was
        5 or 6. My parents thought I was asleep and put it on. I was fascinated
        by it, though, of course, I didn't really understand it at that age. I
        still haven't seen The Exorcist as an adult, though I keep meaning to
        watch it again.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favourite horror tends to be set in remote places like the Arctic and
        space. The Arctic is so vast and unforgiving that you don't really need
        anything supernatural to make it frightening, though I do love a
        monster. Space has always terrified me for similar reasons, as well as
        the fact that we know so little about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like creepy small towns and isolated villages, especially if
        there's a cult or witchcraft involved. Folk horror is probably my
        favourite horror subgenre. I'm really interested in folklore, paganism,
        and history, so I like to see those things represented in horror.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Horror movies</h2>

      <p>
        Other than horror, I like period movies and fantasy. I also love
        basically anything by the Coen Brothers. My all-time favourite movie is
        Amadeus. When I was a kid, Mozart was a huge special interest for me and
        I watched this movie over and over. At first, I was a bit annoyed by the
        historical inaccuracies but quickly grew to love the story.
