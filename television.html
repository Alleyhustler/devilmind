            <figcaption>
              Sitcom set in a bookshop run by a misanthropic alcoholic. It
              reminds me of the knick-nack shop where my mom worked when I was
              little.

            <figcaption>
              Unique supernatural drama set during the Great Depression. Sadly,
              it was cancelled before it got a proper ending.

              Black comedy anthology series set mainly in Minnesota. Based on my
              favourite Coen Brothers movie.

            <figcaption>
              Hilarious parody of 80s horror. It's got Richard Ayoade and Matt
              Berry, both of whom I love.

              Surreal sketch comedy show. I think everyone was watching this
              during the pandemic.

            <figcaption>
              Dark comedy/horror anthology that is a bit hard to describe as
              each episode varies in theme and tone, but I strongly recommend
              it!

            <figcaption>
              Cheesy fantasy fun from the creator of Xena. Based on the Sword of
              Truth by Terry Goodkind, which I'm not a fan of, but very
              different.

            <img src="images/about/madmen.jpg" alt="Mad Men" />
            <figcaption>
              Drama set in a 1960s ad agency. I dislike almost every character,
              but I'm still very invested in their stories.

            <figcaption>
              Sci-fi thriller with an absolutely incredible performance by
              Tatiana Maslany, who plays several different characters.

            <figcaption>
              My mom often had this show on in the background when I was little,
              and now it's always the show I put on when I need comfort.

            <figcaption>
              While I've watched TNG more times, this is my favourite Star Trek
              series. It's a bit darker, with more of an overall story.

            /></a>
            <figcaption>
              My all-time favourite show. The first season covers the horror and
              tragedy of the 1830s Franklin expedition in the Canadian arctic.

            <figcaption>
              Surreal comedy starring Matt Berry. Also has some of his music,
              which is really good!

            <figcaption>
              Dreamy, surreal, mystery. Beautiful setting and music. I also
              really liked The Return, though a lot of people I know hated it.

              Another comedy with Matt Berry, this time about vampires!

            <figcaption>
              Gay warrior women! One of the first things I remember watching on
              TV as a kid, and I still love it today!
            </figcaption>

            <figcaption>
              I also watched this a lot as a kid and developed a fear of space
              and a love for redheaded women as a result.

              Chaotic, slapstick sitcom from the 80s with puppets and musical
              guests.
            </figcaption>

            />
            <figcaption>
              My partner made me watch this, and it's amazing. Set in the future
              with two warring galactic empires. Very gay.
