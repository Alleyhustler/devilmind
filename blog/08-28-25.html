        <h1>Potatoes!</h1>

          This week my partner and I harvested some potatoes we planted! I've
          lived in apartments most of my life, so I've never done any gardening
          before; I only kept sad, unhealthy houseplants. Last year we moved
          into a basement unit in a suburban house where we share the garden
          with our landlady upstairs, it's been really different but nice. Our
          landlady also started a vegetable garden this year and has been
          sharing tons of food with us. She's Korean and grows a lot of Korean
          herbs and veggies that I hadn't tried before. It's difficult living in
          the suburbs as someone who can't drive; the buses are super unreliable
          and everything's far away, but having a garden and our own washer and
          dryer has made up for that. Plus it's much cheaper than Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>
          The landlady was super excited about the potatoes and asked to watch
          the harvest (of course she got some potatoes too). When we first
          started digging them up, I expected to find that they had died or
          hadn't grown at all, but they turned out perfectly! Most likely
          because my partner did the majority of the work. We also planted some
          carrots that should be ready to harvest in a couple months.
        </p>

          So far I've made potato curry and some cheesey potato soup with them,
          both of which were delicious. The skins are super thin and soft at
          first, but they thicken and dry out over time. I also did a little
          photoshoot with a really tiny potato we got.
