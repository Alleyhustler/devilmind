          My dreams often include airports and planes, especially plane crashes.
          Large malls in the middle of nowhere, late night bus rides, and
          confusing bathrooms are also common.

          <summary>Childhood dream</summary>
          <p>
            Between the ages of 5 and 7, I had a recurring nightmare about a dog
            man. The man had the head of a brown laborador and the body of a
            human. He wore a dark suit and a bowler hat. In the dreams, I would
            wake up in the dark, hear a buzzing, and the man would slowly phase
            through the wall next to my bed. Sometimes he would just stand over
            me, and other times he would bend down beside my bed and whisper to
            me. I couldn't understand the whispers; it just sounded like hums,
            clicks, and other random sounds. Often I woke up crying and afraid
            to move.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually my mom asked me about the nightmares. When I described
            the man to her, she was shocked. She told me that she used to dream
            about the same creature when she was little. In her dream, she would
            wake up and go into the kitchen for a glass of water. The fridge
            would open and he would come out and hug her so tightly that she
            couldn't breathe. She had never told anyone about these dreams
            before.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't really believe in anything supernatural, so I think this was
            just a bizarre coincidence. This also happened in a room we called
            “the nightmare room,” as everyone who slept in there would have more
            frequent nightmares. I suspect this was because you could easily
            hear the downstairs neighbours fighting in that room. Eventually I
            stopped having the nightmare after my uncle came to live with us and
            he took the nightmare room.

            This dream was set in a fantasy DnD-ish RPG. I was an elven warlock,
            and in my party there was a human paladin (who looked like Callisto
            from Xena, so that's what I'll call her) and a halfling rogue (Tommy
            Undergallows from Neverwinter Nights). Dragons were attacking a
            city, and I had to protect the royal family. I successfully saved
            everyone in the family except for the heir, a young girl who was
            trapped in a tower that was difficult to access. After reloading
            saves and trying several times, I ended up entering a cheat code to
            increase my speed to see if it was even possible to save her. I
            saved her, but she had no dialogue options, and none of the
            characters acknowledged her being alive. It appeared she was not
            meant to survive, so I reloaded a save and let her die.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dragons were defeated, but we discovered that they were
            controlled by someone. A mysterious plague began sweeping across the
            already half-destroyed city. A princess who was next in line for the
            throne fell ill and asked to see us. She was lying in bed, and I
            noticed her eyes seemed to glow. I felt uncomfortable, and we
            quickly left. That night, Callisto went back to see her and spent
            the night with her. Callisto began acting strange, and her eyes
            glowed like the princess'. She left the party and disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some time talking to people, I heard a rumour of odd people
            gathering in the city's sewers. I went deep into the sewers and
            found a hidden door. Behind the door, there was a massive ancient
            underground ruin. I saw Callisto, the princess, and two others
            speaking to a large crowd. They were wearing robes and seemed to be
            a part of some kind of cult. At this point, my cat began slapping my
            face, and I woke up.

          <p>
            I dreamt of a movie in which
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836121/">Michael Stuhbarg</a>
            played a successful bakery owner in New York/Ancient Rome. His best
            friend, played by
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001354/">Ciarán Hinds</a>, was
            jealous of his success and secretly plotted against him. After many
            failed attempts on his life, Stuhlbarg's character became reclusive
            and wouldn't come out of his home, hiring security guards to protect
            him. Finally, Hinds set fire to Stuhlbarg's home. Stuhlbarg managed
            to escape, but Hinds chased him down and shot him. Hinds became
            emperor of New York City as well as ancient Rome, and the credits
            rolled. The credits felt like a 90s/2000s teen comedy with a song
            that sounded like something from Tony Hawke Pro Skater.

          <p>
            My partner and I went looking for an apartment. We found an old
            Victorian apartment with extremely cheap rent and decided to check
            it out. The building was very beautiful but was falling apart.
            Inside the stairwell, it was very dirty and in need of repair; there
            were cats everywhere. We went up to the building's communal attic,
            and there were even more cats. We met the landlady, and she told us
            that she and the tenants all take care of a colony of cats and let
            them live in the attic. She also told us that one cat was missing,
            and she believed that he got into the apartment we were looking at.
            The cat was very old, and she was worried he was looking for a quiet
            place to die.
          </p>
          <p>
            We opened the door to the apartment and were met with a massive
            hoard of miscellaneous items. There were beautiful antiques and art
            mixed with trash, and everything was covered in dust. As we
            continued through the apartment, we found a room full of 80s and 90s
            My Little Pony. The next room had a TV playing Maury or some other
            trashy daytime TV. This room was particularly dirty, and after
            moving some piles around, we discovered it was the kitchen. We came
            to the bedroom, and it was full of antique clothes from the late
            19th and early 20th centuries. We asked the landlady what happened
            in this apartment, and she told us the previous tenant stopped
            paying rent and went missing. We decided to rent the place, and she
            said we could keep all the previous guys stuff if we took care of
            the cleaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We moved in, and I found the missing cat asleep under a table. He
            didn't move, and I worried that he had indeed died, but after poking
            him, he woke up and angrily slinked out the door. I then began to
            clear out the bedroom. Under a pile of dresses on the bed, I was
            shocked to discover the corpse of the previous tenant, dressed in an
            Edwardian wedding gown. We told the landlady, and he was removed
            from the building. For some reason, I then decided to sleep in the
            bed where this guy died??? In the middle of the night, his spirit
            attacked me, and then I woke up.

            My partner and I were on vacation, along with our cat, Jadzia. We
            visited a little fabric store. This fabric store is a real one that
            I used to go to with my mom when I was little. It had a little play
            area with toys to distract kids while their parents shopped. After
            this, it was already time to go back home. Somehow we managed to
            lose Jadzia's carrier and had to carry her around in our arms.
            Unsurprisingly, we were not allowed to board the plane with a loose
            cat, so we decided that I'd get on the plane alone and my partner
            would buy a carrier and take the next flight.
          </p>

          <p>
            The plane was small but had massive seats. The seating was arranged
            like a booth at a restaurant with a large table surrounded by five
            or six chairs. The cockpit had no door, allowing passengers to see
            the controls and front window. There was only one other passenger at
            my "booth,” and we made small talk. The pilot frequently came out
            and chatted with us, which concerned me as there was no co-pilot. I
            asked her if anyone was in the cockpit, and she told me that the
            plane's autopilot was very advanced and could take off, fly, and
            land on its own without any possibility of crashing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at my phone and saw that my partner had sent me a bunch of
            pictures of him and Jadzia enjoying a “cat park” with a bunch of
            other people and their cats. I then realised that I didn't put my
            phone in airplane mode. The plane suddenly lurched forward and began
            to nose dive. We crashed in a pond next to the airport. I guess the
            crash was not a big deal, so I just went to the airport and waited
            for my partner. When he arrived, he immediately let Jadzia out, and
            she ran around the airport attacking people.

            A random couple came to visit my partner and me at our apartment.
            The apartment was extremely messy, with dust, grime, and dirty
            laundry/dishes covering basically every surface. I offered the
            couple some fruitcake that was sitting in a pile of dirty dishes. I
            finally realized how disgusting everything was and tried to do some
            laundry. The washing machine was covered in hay and leaves. After
            clearing it out, I discovered an enormous rat and took a picture of
            myself pointing at it. In the picture, my hand appeared extremely
            elongated and ghostly. The hand moved and petted the rat, despite it
            being a still image.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was confusedly looking at the picture, the couple asked me
            about the neighbourhood and told me they wanted to open a
            restaurant. I told them they should open a coffee shop or bakery
            instead because there are enough restaurants. They agreed and then
            told me the landlord was selling the building I live in to them, and
            they were going to convert it into a bakery. They gave me an
            eviction notice, and I chased them to their car.

            My partner and I had to move our wedding up from next year to next
            week due to some vague legal issues. I began sewing wedding outfits
            for the both of us. I went to a mall for more sewing supplies. A
            woman there had a gun and started shooting people and taking
            hostages. I tried to sneak out, but the mall was a confusing maze,
            and no matter where I went, I ended up back where the woman was. I
            started to talk to her in order to distract her and avoid being
            killed. We talked about sewing and art. She was an artist, and she
            showed me her extremely disturbing and gory artwork. She then told
            me this attack was performance art. I changed the subject to video
            games, and we discussed our favourites. I randomly brought up
            playing Skyrim on PS3 when it came out, and she made fun of me for
            playing "the worst version of Skyrim ever released." Suddenly, a
            large plane crashed into a nearby field. In the confusion, I escaped
            outside and ran onto a bus that was just about to depart. I got home
            and continued planning the wedding. Miraculously, I finished both
            outfits but woke up before the wedding.

            It was the night before the US election, and my parents were
            fighting with my partner about Kamala Harris. I went out for a walk
            in the forest to get away and found a creepy run-down shack. While
            inspecting it, I was attacked and left for dead in a ditch. I was
            discovered by hikers, but they thought I was dead, so they left me
            and told my parents what happened. I saw everyone grieving but
            couldn't communicate with anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually a necromancer found me and cast a spell that reincarnated
            me as a 1960s businesswoman. I worked in a large skyscraper that
            also contained a hospital. While waiting for the elevator, I met
            another woman who was a doctor at the hospital. Her coworkers were
            all cartoonishly rude and sexist to her. She told me to work hard
            and be strong to prove to the world that women are equal to men. She
            then told me she was dying and collapsed to the floor, melting into
            a puddle of brown and pink goop. I scooped up the goop and dried it,
            turning it into a kind of jerky. I went to the hospital and
            confronted the sexist doctors. While snacking on the human jerky, I
            gave passionate but completely nonsensical speech about the evils of
            sexism, which made the doctors weep and promise to change their
            ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dream then shifted into a mildly horny dream about Raphael and
            Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3 falling in love.
