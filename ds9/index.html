          Deep Space Nine was the third live-action Star Trek TV series, airing
          from 1993 to 1999. Unlike previous Star Trek series', which were all
          set on starships, DS9 is set on a space station. This station, Deep
          Space Nine, was built by the Cardassians, a race of aliens who had
          been occupying the nearby planet Bajor for decades. At the start of
          the series, the Bajorans have just freed themselves from this brutal
          occupation and have asked the United Federation of Planets to help
          them run the station. Shortly after their arrival, the new crew of the
          station discovers a nearby wormhole connecting to the gamma quadrant
          tens of thousands of lightyears away. This is the only stable wormhole
          in the galaxy and holds religious significance to the Bajorans, who
          call it the Celestial Temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          DS9 is less episodic than previous Star Treks, more like The X-Files,
          with a combination of multi-episode/season plots and stand-alone
          episodes.

        <h2 id="characters">The characters:</h2>
        <p>
          DS9 has by far my favourite cast of any Star Trek series. I love
          literally every character and how many of them grow and change in
          interesting ways. As much as I love Star Trek: The Next Generation
          (it's a close second favourite after DS9) I was always a little
          disappointed by how static the characters felt. By the end of the
          show, the only character who felt any different to me was Data. Though
          I also think that's part of why I find TNG so comfy to watch; it
          doesn't change too much. I think because most episodes in DS9 are set
          in one place rather than exploring the galaxy, and because there is
          more of an overall plot connecting different episodes, the writers had
          to spend more time on the relationships between characters.

          <h3>Commander/Captain Benjamin Sisko</h3>

          <p>
            My all-time favourite captain (though he only becomes a captain a
            few seasons in). Sisko is played by Avery Brooks, who also directed
            several episodes, including two of my favourites, Rejoined and Far
            Beyond the Stars. I like Sisko because he feels like a regular guy.
            Unlike many other Star Trek Captains, he has a family that he's
            close with. He's not an obsessive workaholic and has regular hobbies
            like cooking and baseball. He's willing to break rules and do some
            morally grey things for the safety of his crew and the galaxy.
          </p>

            "So... I lied. I cheated. I bribed men to cover the crimes of other
            men. I am an accessory to murder. But the most damning thing of
            all... I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over
            again, I would." — Sisko, "In the Pale Moonlight," Season 6, Episode
            19

          <h3>Jadzia Dax</h3>
          <p>
            Chief Science Officer, played by Terry Farrell. Jadzia is a Trill,
            aliens who are able to surgically join with and host long-lived
            worm-like creatures called symbionts. After a host's death, the
            symbiont can be transferred to another host, retaining all memories
            and experiences. Jadzia's symbiont is named Dax and has had seven
            hosts before Jadzia, including Curzon, a close friend and mentor to
            Captain Sisko.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jadzia is one of my favourite characters; I even named
            <a href="../cats.html">my cat</a> after her. Dax's experiences from
            previous hosts make her character very interesting and unique. She
            has a great ability to relate to and form relationships with
            characters from a variety of alien backgrounds. She's also
            canonically bi/pansexual, and is the first woman to kiss another
            woman on Star Trek. Many fans also see her as a trans allegory due
            to Dax's past hosts having been different genders.

          <h3>Doctor Julian Bashir</h3>
          <p>
            The chief medical officer, played by Siddig El Fadil/Alexander
            Siddig. Bashir comes off as self-absorbed at first, with many
            characters finding him a bit annoying in the beginning. However, as
            time goes on, he forms very close friendships with the rest of the
            crew, especially Garak and O'Brien. Many fans have interpreted the
            relationship between Garak and Bashir as romantic and Garak's actor

            Decks game.

            (after Bashir tells the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf) Bashir —
            "The point is, if you lie all the time, nobody's going to believe
            you even when you're telling the truth."<br />
            Garak — "Are you sure that's the point, Doctor?"<br />
            Bashir — "Of course. What else could it be?"<br />
            Garak — "That you should never tell the same lie twice."<br />

          <h3>Elim Garak</h3>
          <p>
             Garak, played by Andrew Robinson, is a Cardassian tailor working
            aboard Deep Space Nine. Garak is a very mysterious character, often
            making up conflicting stories about his past and why he stayed
            aboard the station after the occupation. Despite his secretive
            personality, he develops a close relationship with Dr. Bashir, with
            whom he enjoys discussing literature and various other topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love Garak's personality and the way he talks. He has so many
            great quotes. I remember the first time I watched DS9, I was so
            fascinated by him and the mystery surrounding his past and
            intentions. I also love the relationship between him and Bashir.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, the truth is usually just an excuse for a lack of

          <h3>Major Kira Nerys</h3>
          <p>
            Played by Nana Visitor. The first officer and Bajoran liaison aboard
            Deep Space Nine. She starts out being suspicious of Starfleet,
            concerned that the Federation simply wants Bajor for themselves, but
            eventually begins to trust them. She was a guerilla fighter during
            the occupation and is very opinionated and resistant to authority.
            She is also devoutly religious, following the Bajoran religion,
            which worships the aliens living in the wormhole. This is fairly
            unique for a Star Trek character of this time, which didn't usually
            have religious main characters (that I can remember at least).

            "Everyone has their reasons. That's what's so terrifying; people can

          <h3>Constable Odo</h3>
          <p>
            Odo is the chief of security, played by the late René Auberjonois
            (who also played the skeleton in The Last Unicorn). He is a
            shape-shifting alien whose origins are unknown at the start of the
            series. Odo's natural state is a sort of liquid goop, but he is able
            to convincingly take the form of many solid creatures and objects.
            However, he struggles to perfectly emulate humanoid faces. His
            personality is very rigid, with a strong sense of order and justice,
            to a fault at times.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was younger, he was by far my favourite character. On more
            recent rewatches, I find his character a bit frustrating, but I
            still like him, especially his interactions with Quark.

            “Commander, laws change, depending on who's making them. Cardassians

          <h3>Miles O'Brien</h3>
          <p>
            The Chief of Operations, played by Colm Meaney. O'Brien also served
            aboard the Enterprise as transporter chief during Star Trek: TNG.
            He's married to Keiko O'Brien, with whom he has a daughter. O'Brien
            frequently goes through traumatic events throughout the series, such
            as being kidnapped and replaced with a clone or being imprisoned in
            a mind prison for 20 years. He and Bashir have a close friendship,
            often playing darts and tennis.
          </p>
          <p>O'Brien is pro-union and we love him.</p>

          <h3>Worf</h3>
          <p>
            Worf had been Chief of Security in TNG before DS9. He joins the cast
            in season four and is made Strategic Operations Officer. He is
            played by Michael Dorn. Worf is a Klingon who was raised on Earth by
            human parents after his parents were killed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Worf was one of my favourite characters in TNG, so I was very
            excited when he came to DS9. It was great seeing how he interacted
            with the new characters. He managed to fit in with the existing cast
            really well. I especially liked his relationship with Jadzia.

          <p>
            Quark is played by Armin Shimmermin. Quark owned a bar on the
            station during the occupation and was coerced into staying aboard by
            Sisko. He is a Farengi, a race of aliens that typically value the
            accumulation of wealth above most other things. Quark is often
            coming up with elaborate, usually illegal, schemes to make money,
            which puts him at odds with Odo. Despite this, he does have a few
            heroic moments.

            Quark to Odo while stranded on a mountain, " The Ascent," Season 5,
            Episode 9

          <h3>Jake Sisko</h3>
          <p>
            Jake is Captain Sisko's son and is played by Cirroc Lofton. He's
            best friends with Nog, Quark's nephew, and the two frequently get up
            to hijinks. Jake enjoys writing and playing

            I didn't like Jake at first because I thought he was kind of
            annoying, but he grew on me after a few seasons. He is the main
            focus of one of my favourite episodes, season 4, episode 3, "The
            Visitor." It's an incredibly sad and touching episode that shows the
            great relationship between Jake and his father.
