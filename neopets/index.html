              Neopets.com is a browser-based game set in a virtual world,
              Neopia, where you can create or adopt creatures called Neopets.
              You can feed these pets, customise their appearance, and train
              them to fight NPCs or other users' pets in the battledome. You can
              also play games; buy, sell, and collect virtual items such as
              stamps; chat and trade with other users; and participate in
              contests, to list a few of the many activities available!

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>
              The site came online November 15th, 1999, founded by Adam Powell
              and Donna Williams, two students at the University of Nottingham.
              It quickly became popular with other students. By January 2000,
              businessman Doug Dohring became CEO of Neopets Inc. Dohring turned
              it into a profitable company through the use of "integrated
              advertising", for example, adding promotional games from various
              companies to the site. Dohring and many of the people he brought
              to the company were also Scientologists. He ran the company
              following a business model from L. Ron Hubbard and apparently
              attempted to add info about Scientology to the site but was,
              thankfully, unsuccessful. More info on this is available in
              <a
                href="https://theoutline.com/post/4190/neopets-was-run-by-scientologists"
                target="_blank"
                >this article.</a
              >
              The site reached its height in popularity in the mid-2000s, with
              around 35 million users by 2005. During this time they began
              selling real-life merchandise like stuffed toys, trading cards,
              and even a monthly magazine.
            </p>

              />

            </figure>
            <p>
              Viacom purchased the site in 2005, and Adam and Donna left,
              unhappy with the direction the site was headed. In 2007 the site
              was completely redesigned, and users were now able to customise
              their pets with clothing and accessories. They also introduced
              Neocash, which was bought with real money and required for many of
              the customisation options. The poses and art style for each Neopet
              were changed to better accommodate customisation. Many were upset
              at these changes, especially the change to the pets, which made
              them more uniform and took away unique poses and expressions. For
              a short time after the redesign, users could choose to keep the
              original art for certain existing Neopets that were changed
              significantly in the new style. If you chose to convert the pet or
              created a new pet, it could not be unconverted, so unconverted
              pets became highly sought after. The site went through some more
              ownership changes in the 2010s. I know very little about what was
              going on between 2011-2020 as I wasn't really playing.

            <p>
              Support for Adobe Flash, used by most games on Neopets, stopped at
              the end of 2020. The Neopets Team worked to convert games to HTML5
              but didn't mange to update them all, leaving many broken for some
              time. However, they were eventually able to use the flash
              emulator, Ruffle, to get all of the games working. At this time
              they also began switching the site to a more mobile-friendly
              layout, though at the time of writing, much of the site has still
              not been converted to the new layout. In 2021 Neopets announced
              The Neopets Metaverse, an NFT ...game? Some of the NFTs made were
              found to have come from Dress to Impress, a fansite, without their
              permission. This project was met with a massive amount of backlash
              and cancelled in 2023.

            <p>
              Also in 2023 Neopets yet again changed ownership, this time
              becoming an independant company. The Neopets Team revealed that
              the company had been running at a loss for the last several years
              and need to find new ways of making money. They released two new
              mobile games, added new benefits for Neopets Premium subscribers,
              and started selling new physical merch. In 2024 Neopets introduced
              pet styles, a way to change converted Neopet art back to their old
              unconverted poses and even added new poses for pets and colours
              that didn't exist pre-conversion. Attempts were also made to
              reduce the inflation that had devolped in the Neopian economy by
              adding new ways to get rare items.

            <p>
              While it lost popularity in the 2010s, the site has had a
              resurgence in the 2020s as older users have come back due to
              nostalgia. I've even encountered a few younger people who were too
              young to play (or not even born yet) when Neopets was at its
              height and are just discovering it now!
