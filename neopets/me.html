        <p>
          I first discovered Neopets in early 2003, after finding a stuffed blue
          Aisha at Target. I was just excited about the weird cat and had no
          idea what Neopets was until I looked it up when I got home. My parents
          had just recently bought our first computer, and I pretty much just
          used the internet to look up pictures of unicorns and listen to Mozart
          midis, so Neopets was completely unlike anything I had ever seen. I
          quickly became obsessed and got my parents and friends to make
          accounts too. I was homeschooled, so Neopets was the first place where
          I could be surrounded by kids my own age and act dumb. I remember
          constantly staying up all night chatting with people and doing
          terrible, cringey Warrior cats roleplay. Neopets was also where I
          <a href="https://www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml" target="_blank"
            >learned HTML</a
          >
          for the first time; I was very proud of my Neverwinter Nights themed
          userlookup.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first account was sadly frozen in 2008, when I was 13. The night
          Obama won the US election, I made a post on the Neoboards
          congratulating him and got into an argument with some people about
          politics. At this point I had already received several warnings from
          Neopets about discussing religion and politics, so I guess this was
          the final straw. You may be wondering why a child was arguing about
          these topics on Neopets.com. I have no idea. Hopefully Obama saw my
          post before it was removed and appreciates what I sacrificed for him.
          I moved to a side account but started to lose interest in the site.
          However, I still visited at least once or twice a year for several
          years until I finally lost the password to my account.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2020 I was reminded of Neopets and decided to see what it was like
          so many years after I had stopped playing. I managed to guess the
          password and fake birthday I used on an old account (I was over 13
          when I made this account, so I have no idea why I used a fake
          birthday) and started playing again. The site was basically the same
          as when I had left it, but I found myself playing quite differently
          than I had when I was a kid. Pet customisation was something I hated
          when it was introduced; I thought it made the pets ugly, but now it's
          my favourite part of the site. Now that I'm older, I'm also much
          better at making and saving neopoints, so I've managed to complete a
          lot of my childhood goals. I'm not a super consistent player; I have
          months where I play every day and months where I don't play at all,
          but I always come back. It's amazing that this site has lasted over 25
          years now; so many other websites from my childhood are long gone. I
          really hope it gets another 25!
